# [**Huuge**](https://www.twitch.tv/huuge) light bot

This is a `state-less` listener to twitch subscription and messaging events

The goal of this bot is to let new subscribers and gifters change the color of Huuge's lights with simple chat command usage

Features:

- A [**notion**](https://www.notion.so) DB containing both subscription events and light changing events
- A [**Lifx**](https://www.lifx.com/) integration to change `remote` Lifx compatible lights
- A [**Sidus Link**](https://www.sidus.link/) integration to change `remote` Sidus Link compatible lights

- An [**ICUE**](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/s/icue) integration to change the `local` Corsair branded lights

`Remote lights` in this context are lights that are not directly connected to the computer

`Local lights` in this context are lights that are directly connected to the computer, either built-in or by cable
